# Crowdfunding ETL Project

**Introduction**
ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) is a foundational skill. In the real world, data is everywhere and often scattered across multiple sources, and it can be messy. Understanding how to extract, load, and transform data is a critical concept as it enables you to have clean, up-to-date, and accurate data. It empowers you to become an expert in your data by allowing you to manipulate data types, fix formatting issues, and create additional columns to enrich and gain meaningful insights from your data. In this project, I will be using the data below to perform extraction, transformation, and loading of the data.

**Database Type for Final Production Environment**
Description: The proposal includes specifying the type of database that will be used for the final production environment to store and manage the data.

Database Type: Relational (SQL)
Data Cleaning and Processing: Jupyter Notebook
Packages Used: pandas, numpy, datetime
Data Loading: pgAdmin

The proposal includes specifying the type of database that will be used for the final production environment to store and manage the data, as well as the tools and packages used for data cleaning and processing. A relational (SQL) database will be used for the final production environment. Data cleaning and processing will be performed using Jupyter Notebook with the following packages: pandas, numpy, and datetime. The cleaned data will be loaded into the relational database using pgAdmin for storage and management. Additionally, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables will be created using a tool like https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to provide a visual representation of the database structure.
